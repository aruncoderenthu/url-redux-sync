# URL-Redux-Sync

Proof of concept project built using CRA to demonstrate pre-filtered search idea for React/Redux/Symfony/Solr app.

## Running the project

```npm install```

```npm start```

## Description
This project is a personal experiment to get familiar with redux-query-sync. I needed to build a project to demonstrate
to myself that this library could be used for another app idea. I needed to 'see' that the URL parameters sync with the
Redux store as I am expecting, as the actual redux-query-sync library doesn't appear to contain a working example (only
instructions). 


### Built With:

* [React](https://github.com/facebook/react/) - React
* [Redux](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux) - App state container
* [redux-query-sync](https://github.com/Treora/redux-query-sync) - Mechanism for syncing URL parameters to Redux state
* [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) - A common React Boilerplate application
